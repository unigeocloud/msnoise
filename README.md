# MSNoise
A Python Package for Monitoring Seismic Velocity Changes using Ambient Seismic Noise.

MSNoise is the first complete software package for computing and monitoring relative velocity variations using ambient seismic noise. MSNoise is a fully-integrated solution that automatically scans data archives and determines which jobs need to be done whenever the scheduled task is executed.

MSNoise is a joint project of the Royal Observatory of Belgium (Thomas Lecocq and Corentin Caudron) and ISTerre + IPGP (Florent Brenguier)
